/**
 * Concept: binary search on nxn matrix
 * When we have a regular sorted 2d array, we use range of index to find our target. for example, lo = 0, hi = length-1, mid = (lo+hi)/2.
 * if the target is greater than the number at index mid, then we search the right portion, if itâ€™s smaller, we search the left.
 * However, in this 2d matrix sorted array, it is impossible to find such mid index. The intuition here is to use a range of numbers to test
 * against our k. We know the first number is the smallest and the last number is the largest, this means our target number must be something in between.
 * We can use those two numbers as our lo and hi, and set our mid to be the number in between, and check how many of the numbers in the matrix
 * are smaller than that number and adjust lo and hi accordingly. When we get exactly k numbers, we know we have found our answer.
 * The extremely tricky part here is that just by looking at how we calculate mid, a lot of times the number we are testing agaist may not even in the matrix,
 * because in the end, the numbers we are using are just arbitrary numbers. To explain this we need to imagine that our program is at a stage where lo and hi
 * are almost going to hit each other. if we counted less numbers than expected, we will set lo=mid+1, this potentially just increment our mid by 1(as lo and hi are going to hit and are roughly the same numbers).
 * And by increment our mid 1 by 1, We can make sure the numbers is included in the matrix.
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
